# Building a Blog with Spring Boot: Part 1 - Initializing the Project

Welcome to the first part of my series where I'll document my journey in creating a blog application using Spring Boot. Today, we'll start by initializing our Spring Boot project using the handy `start.spring.io` service.

## Introduction to Our Blog Application

Before we dive into the technical details, let's talk about what we aim to build. Our goal is to create a simple yet effective blog application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts. As the series progresses, we might add more advanced features and functionalities.

## Initializing the Project with Spring Initializr

### 1. Navigate to start.spring.io

Open your browser and head over to [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io/). This is Spring's official project generator, which helps in creating a boilerplate project with the necessary configurations.

### 2. Project Setup

For our setup:
- I selected **Maven** as the build tool because it's widely used and known for its stability.
- I went with a stable version of **Spring Boot** for up-to-date features and security patches.

### 3. Adding Dependencies

The only dependency we're adding today is:
- **Spring Web**: This will allow us to build web and RESTful applications. It will come handy when we start developing our API endpoints for the blog.

Once you've made these selections, you can generate the project. The browser will download a ZIP file.

### 4. Extracting and Setting Up in IDE

I extracted the ZIP file to a directory of my choice and opened it with IntelliJ IDEA. 


## Conclusion

It might feel like we've done very little today, but setting up a project correctly is crucial for a smooth development experience. By using `start.spring.io`, we've saved ourselves from potential configuration hassles. With our project now initialized, we're all set to delve into the exciting parts of building our blog!
